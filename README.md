# SystemsCS5600
This is my repository for my systems CS5600 class. It is private only for reasons of academic integrity.

Lab 1 is an ‘encrypted’ queue.
Lab 2 is a shell.
It supports chained commands using the ‘&&’ operator and the pipe operator.
Lab 3 is an asynchronous key-value store.
It uses a lock system.
Lab 4 is a toy kernel that allocates memory pages on the heap and the stack to program stubs.
Lab 5 is a file system that uses inodes to resolve file names and supports symbolic linking.
